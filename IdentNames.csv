The night we got in trouble we had only about $150 but the night we got away with it we had clear over $5,000 worth of fireworks. We had a whole fireworks stand. We had a truck load, ok, it was a trailer. We had staked out a trailer with one of them little fireworks stands next to it and a trailer here. The trailer was about eighty feet away from the one we had picked to go inside. We tried taking off the hinges and that didn't work. It was late at night. It was in âtown name removedã, rural area. I had just figured that we would pull the plywood off the back to where you could just walk right in. It was over about $5,000 we had. My intention was to take big cones, not little stuff but we just took everything. And granted you just see all that stuff on top but they got cases underneath. Those things are filled with a lot of money. There was three registers there that were audited and ready for the next morning. I forget how much each one had. They had dollar bills in change in each one, there was three of them. You go to a fireworks stand and you spend $100. We used to sell like $400 worth of fireworks for $200. That lasted for all throughout July until I got caught doing it. Then we ran out. We had plenty of money. If I would put this money in the bank I wouldn't be were I'm at now. It was my idea. Nobody split this with me. What I gave to somebody, I gave away. I was by myself, with âname removedã, he was 14 and we made two trips. It was unbelievable, we was making a lot of noise. I fell once inside the place. It was very unprofessional. There was a lot of money involved in that one. The recent one was, a friend of mine works at âbusiness name removedã I let him borrow $30. He had stolen a bunch of fireworks from where he works and kept them in his house in a trailer. So we broke into the trailer. That was very professional because he couldn't tell if somebody had broken or if his wife took them and shot them off because we used a comb to get in the front door. He had a chain so all we did was push the door back and I slide in there. I'm skinny so there's a lot of places I can slide in. Slid in there, unlocked the door, got the fireworks, brought them out to the car, locked the latched again so you couldn't tell, closed the closet, did everything and jumped out the back door and locked it the way it was. We didn't take nothing inside his apartment but the fireworks and that was it. Firework stands are big investments, you figure a gross of bottle rockets is $4.00 nowadays. We had six cases of those things. I think there was 100 of them in a box, you figure at $4.00 apiece, that's about $400 a case and we had six cases of those.
